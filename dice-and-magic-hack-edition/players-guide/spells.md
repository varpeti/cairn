# Spells

- `[dice]` are equal to **Magic Dice** invested in the spell.
- `[sum]` is a number equal to the sum of rolled **Magic Dice**.
- An **item** is anything you can lift with one hand, and an **object** is anything up to human sized.
- Unless otherwise noted, all spells with ongoing effects last up to  `[sum]`×10 minutes (`[sum]`*5 Rounds in combat), and have a range of up to 12 meter (= 8 Space = 40 feet).
