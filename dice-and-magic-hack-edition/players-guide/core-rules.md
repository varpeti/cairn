# Core Rules

## Attributes

Each of the three **Attributes** are used in different circumstances. (See **Saves**, below.)

- **Strength (STR)**: Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.
- **Dexterity (DEX)**: Used for saves requiring poise, speed, reflexes, dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.
- **Willpower (WIL)**: Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate spells, etc.

## Basic units

- 1 Action Point (AP) = 3 sec
- 1 Round in combat = 2 Minutes
- 1 Space = 1.5 meter = 5 feet

## Actions

Action is a roll to do something which can Succeed or Fail.
Initiator is the Character trying to do the Action.

- The Initiator describes the action they want to do.
- The Warden decide if it is trivial (auto Succeed or Fail), or the Initiator should roll for it.
- The Warden decide if it is a Contested Check (CC) or Dice Check (DC)
  - If it is a DC:
    - The Warden decide the DC (20 is an average DC higher means harder lower means easier)
    - The Warden can disclose the DC if appropriate
  - If it is a CC:
    - Notifies the Target(s) to make a [Save](#saves)
- The Warden decides the following with the Initiator:
  - [Attribute](#attributes) used as a modifier
  - If one or more object is used, use their Object Dice (Eg. Weapon, Shield, etc)
  - Based on the situation, for each dice, including the base d20 dice, decide if it has:
    - one or multiple **Advantage** (roll +N dice, and use the higher roll)
    - one or multiple **Disadvantage** (roll +N dice, and use the lowest roll)
- The Initiator roll the dice, then adds the modifier: `Base Dice (d20) + Modifiers + Object Dice`
- The Initiator announces the Result to the Warden, it is the **IR**
- If it is a DC: [Check Results (IR vs DC)](#check-results-ir-vs-tr)
- If it is a CC: [Check Results (IR vs TR)](#check-results-ir-vs-tr)

### Example Actions (Tip)

These are just example actions, to help you start thinking, do not treat it as list of only possible things to do!

- I want to attack it with my weapon
- I want to shoot it with my bow
- I want to kick the weapon out of his hand
- I want to grab it with both hands to restrict it, and expose it to my friend
- I want to Rush towards it, and shove it into the chasm
- I want to kick off its legs under it, so it will fall on the ground
- I want to dodge the next attack against me (Held Action, can give yourself Adv when you are the Target)
- I want to parry the next attack against me (Held Action)
- I want to parry the next attack against me, and attack back immediately (2 Held Action)
- I want to trip him when he runs past me (Held Action)

> Be bold, think outside of the box, use everything available, you can even try to do impossible things, just be prepared for the consequences:

- I want to seduce the dragon, that wiped half our party already (Nat20: Congrats: The dragon likes you, he grabs you and takes you home. He is possessive and will never let you leave its lair.)
- I want to seduce the door (Nat20: Congrats: The door likes you. But it will not open up, even for you)


### Example 1 (Action)

- Ael'Onor (PC): I want to Attack Bo'Mack with my Two-Handed, Recently Sharpened Axe:
- GM: Then that would be contested by Bo'Mack:
  - Use your STR as modifier
  - Roll with +1 Adv because he is occupied with another attacker
  - Use Axe's dice to the roll, you can throw it with Adv because it is sharp
- Ael'Onor Then I'll Attack with...
  - Rolls the dice, adds the modifiers
  - ... 28

</details>

### Special Actions in Combat

- Move (1 AP): Initiator can move up to their half **DEX** rounded up Spaces until their end of turn. (1 Space = 1.5 meter)
- Gain Advantage (1 AP): Initiator can add Advantage for its Base Dice for the next roll. Can be used multiple times.
- Held Action (X AP): Initiator describes the Action and the condition(s), and when the condition(s) are met, the Action happens.
  - If the condition is not met until the Initiator next turn, the held action cancels.
  - Now: Use the AP cost, decide the modifiers, Object Dice, Advantage(s) and Disadvantage(s) with the Warden.
  - When then Action happens: Other resources will be used, then the Initiator Rolls.

## Saves

A Save is a roll to avoid negative outcomes.
Target is the Character trying to avoid or mitigate the situation.

- The Warden describes the situation to the Target.
- The Target describes what they want to do to avoid or mitigate the situation.
- If it is a Dice Check (DC):
  - The Warden decide the DC (20 is an average DC higher means harder lower means easier)
  - The Warden can disclose the DC if appropriate
- If it is a Contested Check (CC):
  - The Initiator should be already ready to roll the [Action](#actions)
- The Warden decides the following with the Target:
  - [Attribute](#attributes) used as a modifier
  - If one or more object is used their Object Dice (Eg. Weapon, Shield, etc)
  - Based on the situation, for each dice, including the base d20 dice, decide if it has:
    - one or multiple **Advantage** (roll +N dice, and use the higher roll)
    - one or multiple **Disadvantage** (roll +N dice, and use the lowest roll)
- The Target roll the dice, then adds the modifier: `Base Dice (d20) + Modifiers + Object Dice`
- The Target announces the Result to the Warden, it is the **TR**
- If it is a DC: [Check Results (DC vs TR)](#check-results-ir-vs-tr)
- If it is a CC: [Check Results (IR vs TR)](#check-results-ir-vs-tr)

### Example 1 (Save)

- GM: So Ael'Onor tries to Attack Bo'Mack
- GM: And Bo'Mack (NPC) will contest it, and tries to block the attack.
- GM: It is a CC and the DD is already set.
- GM: Bo'Mack tries to block the attack by its shield
  - Bo'Mack will use STR as modifier
  - Bo'Mack will add the Heater's Dice to the roll
  - Bo'Mack will roll without Adv or DisAdv
- GM: Then for Bo'Mack's roll...
  - Rolls the dice, adds the modifiers
  - ... 21

### Example 2 (Save)

- GM: So Ael'Onor, as you seek through the Old Mage's room, you step on a lose block, suddenly with a loud creek the ceiling opens and a big boulder drops on you, what are you doing next?
- Ael'Onor: I quickly check the source of the loud sound, and when I see the boulder failing on to me, I try to dodge it.
- GM: Okey then, in this case:
  - Writes down the DC (24)
  - Use AGI to check if you notices it in time, can dodge it,
  - Roll with +1 DisAdv because you were not careful during the search
- Ael'Onor: Then I'll roll...
  - Rolls the dice, adds the modifiers
  - ... 12 and I rolled a Natural 1

</details>

## Check Results (IR vs TR)

Stuff happens, and when it happens it can Succeed or Fail.

- Compare the IR (or DC) with the TR (or DC)
  - IR is larger or equal to TR: The Initiator Succeed the [Action](#actions). The Warden describes the outcome or prompt the Initiator (and Target) to describes it.
  - IR is smaller than the TR: The Target Succeed the [Save](#saves). The Warden describes the outcome or prompt the Target (and Initiator) to describes it.
- For Natural 1 and Natural 20 on the Base Dice: The Warden should describes what extraordinary things happens.
- When appropriate, use the Object Dice to calculate further things, (Eg: Damage of an attack: `Initiator's Weapon Dice`)

### Example 1 (Check Result)

- GM: So Ael'Onor IR is 28, 6 on the Axe Dice, Bo'Mack TR is 21 and has 1 armor
- GM: Bo'Mack suffers 5 damage, Ael'Onor, describe how you attacked Bo'Mack.
- Ael'Onor: *describing the successful attack*
- Bo'Mack: *describing the failed defense*

### Example 2 (Check Result)

- GM: So the DC is 24, TR is 12 (with Nat1)
- GM: You failed to notice the boulder in time, you had no chance to dodge it, and it fallen directly onto you. It is a heavy boulder, so you suffer 3 damage.
- GM: Also while you are busy being flattened, the old mechanism of this trap fails, and a sharp piece falls directly on to your face. It deals 1 more damage.

## Healing & Recovery

- Resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost HP but may leave the party exposed. Bandages can stabilize a character that has taken critical damage.
- Attribute loss (see [Critical Damage](#critical-damage)) can usually be restored with a week's rest, facilitated by a healer or other appropriate source of expertise.
- Some healing services are free, while magical or more expedient means of recovery may come at a cost.

## Deprivation and Fatigue

- A PC that lacks a crucial need (such as food or rest) is **Deprived**. Anyone **Deprived** for more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their inventory, one for each day. A **Deprived** PC cannot recover HP, Attributes, or item slots from **Fatigue**.
- A PC may also be forced to add **Fatigue** after casting spells or due to events occurring in the fiction. Each Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until the PC is able to recuperate (such as with a full nightâ€™s rest in a safe spot).
- If a character is forced to add **Fatigue** to their inventory but they have no free slots, they must drop an item from their inventory.

## Armor

- Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target's **Armor** value from the result of damage rolls.
- Armor provide a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is worn. Some may also provide additional benefits, depending on the fiction.
- A PC, NPC, or monster cannot have more than 3 Armor.

## Reactions

When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Warden may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

|         |      |         |      |         |
| :-----: | :--: | :-----: | :--: | :-----: |
|    2    | 3-5  |   6-8   | 9-11 |   12    |
| Hostile | Wary | Curious | Kind | Helpful |

## Morale

- Enemies must pass a WIL save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number.
- Some groups may use their leader's WIL in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they're reduced to 0 HP.
- Morale does not affect PCs.

## Hirelings

- Adventuring parties can recruit hirelings, relying on their unique skills, knowledge, and training to aid in expeditions.
- To create a hireling, choose an appropriate role from the [Hirelings](/cairn/dice-and-magic-hack-edition/players-guide/marketplace#hirelings-per-day) table in the Marketplace. Roll 3d6 for each attribute and 1d6 for their HP. Give them **equipment** appropriate to their station, then roll on the Character Traits tables to further flesh them out.
- Alternatively, choose an appropriate [**background**](/cairn/dice-and-magic-hack-edition/players-guide/character-creation#backgrounds) and **name** from the [Character Creation](/cairn/dice-and-magic-hack-edition/players-guide/character-creation) guide. Roll (or choose from) the tables for that background. Then roll for Rations, Gold Pieces, Attributes, HP, and age.
- The Warden can decide if the Hireling should be played by one of the PCs.

## Die of Fate

- Optionally, roll 1d6 whenever the outcome of an event is uncertain or to simulate an element of randomness and chance.
- A roll of 4 or more generally favors the PCs, while a roll of 3 or under usually means bad luck for the PCs.

## Combat

[Basic Units](#basic-units)

### Initiative roll

- Each creature rolls an initiative roll (`1d20 + **WIL**`)
- The initiative is sorted from largest to lowest, for each Group separately.
- Turns are arranged so that each Group takes one Turn at a time, so when a member of one Group takes a Turn, theyâ€™re followed by a member of an other Group taking a Turn. This continue rotating until each member of each Group has taken a Turn.

### Turn

- Each Creature (usually) has 4 Action Point (AP) (About 12 second to act / turn)
  - Surprised Creatures have only 2 AP until their first turn ends.
- Each Creature can use the APs to do Actions. Saves are usually not using AP.
  - The Warden decides the AP cost of a described Action based on how long it should take.
- Each Creature regains its maximum AP at their end of turn. (Tip: Use all of your AP, before the end of your turn)

### Attacking & Damage

- The attacker describes the [Action](#actions) they want to do, if it is an attack, and it hit:
  - Use their Weapon Dice and subtracts the Target's armor bonuses, then deals the remaining total to their opponent's HP.
    - Unarmed attacks always do d4 damage.
- If an attack would take a Creature (including PCs) HP 0 or under refer to the [Critical Damage](#critical-damage) section.
  - If it is a PC's refer to the [Scars](#scars-table) table to see how they are uniquely impacted.


### Attack Modifiers (Advantage / Disadvantage)

- If fighting from a position of weakness (such as through cover or with bound hands), the attack is *Impaired*, and the attacker must roll with Disadvantage on the Base Die (see: [Actions](#actions))
- If fighting from a position of advantage (such as against a helpless foe or through a daring maneuver), the attack is *Enhanced*, allowing the attacker to roll with Advantage on the Base Die (see: [Actions](#actions))
- Attacks against multiple targets, the Attacker rolls once, and Each Target roll a [Save](#saves). This can be anything from explosions to a dragonâ€™s breath or the impact of a meteorite.
- Attacking with two weapons at the same time, the Attacker rolls both damage dice and keep the single highest result.

### Critical Damage

- Damage that reduces a Target's HP below zero is subtracted *from their STR* by the amount of damage remaining. The target must then immediately make a *STR* [Save](#saves) (DC=15) to avoid taking **Critical Damage**, using their *new STR score*. On a success, the target is still in the fight (albeit with a lower *STR* score) and must continue to make Critical Damage Saves when incurring damage.
- Any PC that suffers Critical Damage cannot do anything but crawl weakly, grasping for life. If given aid (such as bandages), they will stabilize. If left untreated, they die within the hour. NPCs and monsters that fail a Critical Damage Save are considered dead, per the **Warden's** discretion. Additionally, some enemies will have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a Critical Damage Save.

### Attribute Loss

- If a PC's STR is reduced to 0, they die. If their DEX is reduced to 0, they are paralyzed. If their WIL is reduced to 0, they are delirious. Complete DEX and WIL loss renders the character unable to act until they are restored through extended rest or by extraordinary means.

### Character Death

- When a character dies, the player should create a new character or take control of a hireling. They can immediately join the party in order to reduce downtime.

### Detachments

- Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single *Detachment*. When a *detachment* takes **Critical Damage**, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.
- Attacks against detachments by individuals are *impaired* (excluding *blast* damage). Attacks against individuals by detachments are *enhanced* and deal *blast* damage.

### Retreat

- Running away from a dire situation always requires a successful *DEX* [Save](#saves), as well as a safe destination to run to.

### Ranged Attacks

- Ranged weapons can target any enemy near enough to see the whites of their eyes. Attacks against especially distant targets are *Impaired*.
- Ammunition is not tracked unless otherwise specified.

## Scars

If damage to a PC would reduce their HP to 0 or under, look up the result on the table below based on *how much HP the PC had before the last attack*

- Examples:
  - If a PC went from 3 HP to 0 HP, they would look at entry #3 (Walloped).
  - If a PC went from 3 HP to -1 HP, they would look at the entry #3 (Walloped).
  - If a PC went from 4 HP to 2 HP, then in another attack to -4 HP, they look at the entry #2 (Rattling Blow).

### Scars Table

|             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 1           | Lasting Scar: Roll 1d6. 1: Neck, 2: Hands, 3: Eye, 4: Chest, 5: Legs, 6: Ear. Roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.                                                                     |
| 2           | Rattling Blow: Youâ€™re disoriented and shaken. Describe how you refocus. Roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.                                                                           |
| 3           | Walloped: Youâ€™re sent flying and land flat on your face, winded. You are deprived until you rest for a few hours. Then, roll 1d6. Add that amount to your max HP.                                                         |
| 4           | Broken Limb: Roll 1d6. 1-2: Leg, 3-4: Arm, 5: Rib, 6: Skull. Once mended, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.                                                                         |
| 5           | Diseased: Youâ€™re afflicted with a gross, uncomfortable infection. When you get over it, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.                                                           |
| 6           | Reorienting Head Wound: Roll 1d6. 1-2: STR, 3-4: DEX, 5-6: WIL. Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your current attribute, take the new result.                                                                        |
| 7           | Hamstrung: You can barely move until you get serious help and rest. After recovery, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max DEX, take the new result.                                                              |
| 8           | Deafened: You cannot hear anything until you find extraordinary aid. Regardless, make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by 1d4.                                                                              |
| 9           | Re-brained: Some hidden part of your psyche is knocked loose. Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max WIL, take the new result.                                                                                    |
| 10          | Sundered: An appendage is torn off, crippled, or useless. (The Warden will tell you which.) Then make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by 1d6.                                                              |
| 11          | Mortal Wound: You are deprived and out of action. You die in one hour unless healed. Upon recovery, roll 2d6. Take the new result as your max HP.                                                                         |
| 12          | Doomed: Death seemed ever so close, but somehow you survived. If your next save against critical damage is a fail, you die horribly. If you pass, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result. |

## Magic

### Grimoire

- You carry a **Grimoire** worth 300gp. It is [bulky](/cairn/dice-and-magic-hack-edition/players-guide/character-creation/#inventory), and it contains the spells.
- For the spell list refer to [Spell List](./spells)

### Mana Dust

- Mana dust can be used instead of Inventory slot to for **Magic Dice** (d6). In this way, the used Mana dust cannot produce fatigue.

### Casting Spells:

- Holding your **Grimoire** in both hands, choose a spell. The description may denote the spell's duration with **D** and range with **R**.
- You have an amount of **Magic Dice** (d6) equal to the amount of available [inventory slots](/cairn/dice-and-magic-hack-edition/players-guide/#inventory) and [Mana Dust](#mana-dust). Choose how many you wish to invest (up to a maximum of 4). Spells will refer to these as `[dice]`. Some spells will refer to their `[sum]` as well.
- Roll `[dice]`. For each inventory slot die that shows a 4-6, you gain one [Fatigue](#deprivation-and-fatigue).
- If you get 2 matches (Eg: two dice rolled 4), something has gone very wrong. Look up the spell's `[sum]` on the **Mishaps** table below for what happens next.
- If you get 3 matches or more (Eg: 3 dice rolled 5), something has gone terribly wrong. Look up the spell's `[sum]` on the **Mishaps** table below for what happens next, and consider the spell failed.

#### Mishaps (compare result to [sum])

|         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 2       | You cannot cast spells for 1d6 hours, and any attempts to manipulate magic will fail.|
| 3       | For the next 24 hours, when casting spells you gain a Fatigue on a roll of 3-6.|
| 4       | There is a chain reaction to the spell (the Warden will say how). Take an additional Fatigue.|
| 5       | The Spell's effects are reversed; the Warden will tell you how. Take an additional Fatigue.|
| 6       | Any objects in your inventory that are not made of metal instantly combust. You are now immune to fire for short bursts.|
| 7       | You are [deprived](#deprivation-and-fatigue). After recovery, roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.|
| 8       | You take 1d4 *WIL* damage when casting spells for the next 24 hours. Afterwards roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max WIL, take the new result.|
| 9       | The spell turns your skin a dark shade of purple, and makes you invisible in the moonlight. Your eyes however glow a bright yellow at night.|
| 10      | You become insubstantial for 1d4 hours as your spirit leaves your body, which remains unconscious. You can fly and pass through walls, but not touch anything. Also, no one can see or hear you through mundane means.|
| 11      | You suffer horrible arcane burns; lose 1d4 *WIL*. From now on you can use +1 **Magic Dice** for free (up to the limit) (use a die of a different color). If it results in a 4-6 you lose 1 WIL.|
| 12      | The spell backfires; you lose 1 inventory slot (scratch it off your sheet). You are now surrounded by a magical essence that provides +1 Armor (normal limits still apply).|
| 13      | Your **Grimoire** is damaged and unusable. Creating a new **Grimoire** from its remains restores the original spells as well.|
| 14      | Instead of Fatigue, the spell causes magical tumors to fill their respective slots. They can only be removed by a specialized healer. Upon recovery, you are able to ignore a single Fatigue taken from spellcasting. If the spell did not cause Fatigue, you are [deprived](/cairn-srd/#deprivation--fatigue).|
| 15      | Arcane energies wrack your body as a piece of your soul is transferred into your **Grimoire**. You lose half your WIL (rounded down). Your **Grimoire** now appears in any form you wish and takes no space in inventory. It cannot be destroyed except by your own death, and vice-versa.|
| 16      | You permanently lose 1d4 STR as the spell interacts with nearby plant life, which rips out of the earth and fuses against your skin. You have +1 Armor, although fire does enhanced damage against you. You can only feed by photosynthesis.|
| 17      | You are transformed into something weird and unnatural (the Warden will say exactly how). Others will have difficulty looking at you. If someone doesn't focus on you, you are invisible. You fail any attempts at persuasion.|
| 18      | One your hands becomes fused with your **Grimoire**. You can never let go of it, however it only takes up 1 inventory slot. You can fire a bolt of arcane energy from that hand that deals 1d6 damage. If your hand is cut off, you can never cast spells again.|
| 19      | Large ugly wings sprout from your back, ripping through whatever you are wearing. You gain 1d4 *DEX* and can fly. You cannot wear armor or a backpack, and have a only 5 inventory slots.|
| 20      | You dimensionally swap limbs with a magical being from an alien plane. Gain its properties (ask the Warden), both good and bad. Also: it's coming for you, and it's mad as hell. |
| 21      | An extra-planar deity senses your arcane power (ask the Warden which). You are now linked, and can call on it for aide. It can likewise ask you for help, and punish you for non-compliance. Good luck.|
| 22      | Your body becomes a vessel of pure magical energy. You no longer need to consume food, water or air. Fatigue and Mishaps from casting spells does not affect you, but instead you lose 1d4 STR on a result of 5-6. At STR 0 you become a spell (ask the Warden which). You can smell magic.|
| 23      | You create an exact duplicate of yourself. One grows older while the other grows younger. Both age at at the rate of 1 year per day. Your thoughts are joined, and if one dies so does the other. Only magical aide will restore you; afterward add +1d6 to each ability score.|
| 24      | You have become Elemental. Create a **True Name** for yourself. Magical energies surround you at all times, and mundane attacks against you are impaired. If someone learns your **True Name**, they can control you. Other Elementals will come for you.|

##### **Example**

***Barry** has 2 free inventory slots and 2 Mana Dust, giving him 4 **Magic Dice**. He selects the spell **Mirror Image**:*

**Mirror Image**: [dice] illusory duplicates of yourself appear under your control.

_He decides to invest 2 Mana Dust and 1 Inventory slot to his **Magic Dice**. That means he can create **three** duplicates that last for **thirty** minutes each.

He rolls: double 2s and a 5. The spell effects occur, and he takes one [Fatigue](#deprivation-and-fatigue). However, he also rolled a **series**, meaning a Mishap has occurred as well. He gets the `[sum]` of the dice - 9 - and looks up the effect on the Mishaps table._

### Additional Rules

### **Scrolls**

- Scrolls contain a single spell and are destroyed after a single use. Otherwise, they work exactly the same as spells recorded in your **Grimoire**.

### **Copying Spells**

- You may copy spells found in Scrolls to your **Grimoire**.
- It costs 50gp for the gold inks and takes 6 hours to complete, reduced by `[sum]` hours.
- The Scroll is destroyed in the process.

### **Creating a Grimoire**

Creating a **Grimoire** is time-consuming and expensive. You will need:

- A single Scroll, which is sacrificed through the process.
- 200gp in inks, as well as a blank book.
- 6 hours of undisturbed labor in the light of a full moon. Afterwards, you are [deprived](#deprivation-and-fatigue).
- The spell contained within the Scroll becomes the first recorded spell.
